## Docker

Build the docker container by running:

```

Run the docker container by running:

The Toolbox-ui needs the [toolbox-api](https://github.com/tiborhercz/toolbox-api).
Following the installation instructions to get the API running.
You could also use docker-compose which can be found here: [toolbox-docker](https://github.com/tiborhercz/toolbox-docker).
